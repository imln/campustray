			<p>Debate should be lively but also constructive and respectful. Don't incite hatred on the basis of race, religion, gender, nationality or sexuality or other personal characteristic. Don't swear, use hate-speech or make obscene or vulgar comments. Don't break the law. This includes libel, condoning illegal activity and contempt of court (comments which might affect the outcome of an approaching court case). Don't engage in 'spamming'. Don’t advertise products or services. Don't impersonate or falsely claim to represent a person or organisation. Don't post in a language other than English. Protect your privacy and that of others. Please don’t post private addresses, phone numbers, email addresses or other online contact details. Stay on-topic. Please don't post messages that are unrelated to the topic. If a comment contravenes the discussion rules it  will be removed from the blog.</p>
